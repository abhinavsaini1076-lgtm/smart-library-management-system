Smart Library Management System is a C++ console-based project that simulates the working of a modern library using core data structures. It manages books, users, and borrowing operations efficiently. Hash tables are used for fast ISBN-based book search, binary search trees for title-based searching, linked lists for user management, and queues for handling book issue and return requests. The system also generates reports such as most borrowed books, active users, and currently issued books. This project demonstrates practical application of data structures and object-oriented programming concepts.
